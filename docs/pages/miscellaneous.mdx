> `unless`

```elixir
@spec unless(boolean(), any(), any()) :: any()
```

Executes a callback function unless a condition is true. If the condition is true, undefined is returned.
If the condition is false, the callback function is executed and its return value is returned.

```js
const person = {
  name: "John",
  canVote: false,
  age: 30,
};

unless(person.age < 18, () => {
  person.canVote = true;
});

console.log(person);
// => { name: "John", age: 30, canVote: true }
```
